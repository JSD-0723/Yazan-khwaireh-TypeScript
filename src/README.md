# Hanna-Hinn-typescript

Create a book library app that handles book rent journeys. So, what is needed for now is to create a NodeJS application using TypeScript:

Create a JSON file containing an array of objects for books details, an example of an object: { name: 'book_name,' author: 'book_author', ISBN: '123456' }  
Create a GET request that accepts a string in the query and returns all books whose names start with that string.  
Don't miss handling errors (expected and unexpected).
